## Here's some information about me...

I currently live in North Yorkshire and are developing bespoke vision AI products for a security company. 
Before this I ran a IT service company specialising in cyber security and software devlopment.  


### Here's some more information about me...
My passion for IT properly started when I was around 4 years old. I quickly was introduced by my grandparents (at a very young age) to alot of the techonlogical landscape at the time, as they realised early on that technology (especially computing) was going to be the key to my success for whatever career path I would take in the future. 

Halfway through graduating primary school, they bought me my first PC (an IBM clone PC) and afforded me the opportunity to attend basic computer courses for kids. This is where I started to develop basic skills and found great enjoyment by practicing them at home. I attended these courses every weekend and by the end of primary school I was attending beginners programming courses for adults.

By the time, I had entered secondary school and I had mastered all of the Office products of the day and knew my way around Windows 3.x and 9x OS's. I was also at that this time teaching my teachers at school how to do things in class and became my family and family friends "go to" system admin, at this time. 

While studying for my GCSES, I was again awarded another great opportunity, which was to work as a junior IT technician 3 days a week, from the age of 12. This was at a well known busisness services company in the city where i lived. Here I learn't alot of professional skills including IT skills. I learnt how to administer Windows Server environments and other enterprise software. I also learnt other basic skills from how to build a PC to how to spec out hardware for a client's busisness. All very valuable infomation, which I still draw upon to this day. While also working at the company, the business and my school also helped pay for general IT courses and Microsoft certification courses. Doing all of this meant that after leaving school and the 3 days a week work experience. I had become advanced in the world of IT way beyond my years and was able to have insights in the industry which my peers wouldn't see for another 4 - 10 years at least. I credit this time as being the true starting point in my career and I realise (even this early on) I was very fortunate to have had such experiences.

After leaving school, I tried further education, but at this point, I found working in my craft more of a fulfilling experience and would find the first opportunity to work instead.

Ever since then I have kept my hand in all forms of IT and have never stopped learning.
