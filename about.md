Some information about me. I currently live in North Yorkshire and are developing new vision AI products for the home security market for a nationwide security company. Before this I ran a IT service company specialising in cyber security and software devlopment.  


### More Information
My passion for IT properly started when I was 4 years old. As I was born in the early 90's and grew up with the invention of the WWW among other modern technological advances. I quickly was introduced by my grandfather (at a very young age) to alot of the techonlogical landscape at the time, as he realised early on that technology (especially computing) was going to be the key to success for whatever career path I would take in the future. 
Halfway through graduating primary school, he bought me my first PC (an IBM PC) and afforded me the opportunity to attend computing courses. This is where i started to devlop basic skills and found great enjoyment by practicing them at home. I attended these courses and progressing to advanced programming courses for adults by the end of my primary education.
By the time, I had entered secondary school I had mastered all of the Office suites and the Windows 3.x and 9x OS's and teaching my teachers how to do things in class and was my family and family friends "go to" system admin at this time.
While studying for my GCSES I was again awarded another great opportunity, which was to work as a junior IT technician 3 days a week, at a well known (at the time) busisness services company in the city where i lived.
