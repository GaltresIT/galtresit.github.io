Here's some information about me. I currently live in North Yorkshire and are developing new vision AI products for the home security market for a nationwide security company. Before this I ran a IT service company specialising in cyber security and software devlopment.  


### More Information
My passion for IT properly started when I was around 4 years old.

As I was born in the early 90's and grew up with the invention of the WWW among other modern technological advances. I quickly was introduced by my grandfather (at a very young age) to alot of the techonlogical landscape at the time, as he realised early on that technology (especially computing) was going to be the key to success for whatever career path I would take in the future. 
Halfway through graduating primary school, he bought me my first PC (an IBM PC) and afforded me the opportunity to attend computing courses. This is where i started to devlop basic skills and found great enjoyment by practicing them at home. I attended these courses and progressing to advanced programming courses for adults by the end of my primary education.

By the time, I had entered secondary school I had mastered all of the Office products of the day and knew my way around Windows 3.x and 9x OS's. I was also at that this time teaching my teachers at school how to do things in class and became my family and family friends "go to" system admin, at this time. 

While studying for my GCSES I was again awarded another great opportunity, which was to work as a junior IT technician 3 days a week, from the age of 12, at a well known busisness services company in the city where i lived. Here I learn't alot of professional IT skills. Such as how to administer Windows Server environments and other enterprise software. I also learn't other basic skills from how to build a PC to how to spec out hardware for a client's busisness. All very valuable infomation, which I still draw upon to this day. While also working at the company, the business and my school also helped pay for general IT courses and Microsoft certification courses. Doing all of this meant that after leaving school and the 3 days a week work experiance. I had became advanced in the world of IT way beyond my years and has seen things my peers wouldn't see for another 4 - 10 years at least. 
After leaving school, I tried further education, but at this point, I found working in my craft a more fulfilling experience and would find the first opportunity to work instead.

Ever since I have kept my hand in IT industry and have never stopped learning.
